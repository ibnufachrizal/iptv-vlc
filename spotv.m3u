# Some tv channels use DRM, maybe the channel cannot be played (usually stuck loading) because your device does not support DRM.
# This is a live tv playlist selected for OTT Player app only (you can find it in Play Store but i don't know is that available in App Store).
# PLEASE DO NOT REBROADCAST IPTV STREAM OR SELL IPTV URLS.
# You must be wondering why these new channels are so few compared to before, this is because I select channel URLs that are truly safe for your device from data theft and that are still actively broadcasting.
